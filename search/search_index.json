Comparing the simulation results of soil freezing and thawing dates, BCC-CSM2-MR's simulation of the total dates of freezing and thawing, especially for the ablation process stage, is close to the observed value.  However, the dates of the complete freezing phase and the ablation process phase have been delayed, which may be related to the slower soil temperature drop due to the imperfect physical parameterization process of the land model.  The evaluation of frozen soil depth shows that BCC-CSM2-MR has the best simulation on the frozen soil depth change curve in the early period of the soil freezing period.  Due to the low grid resolution and the inaccurate description of the terrain, BCC-CSM2-MR cannot simulate the depth distribution of frozen soil alternately distributed in the southwestern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.  In the soil temperature trend analysis, BCC-CSM2-MR showed an increasing trend in soil temperature from 1985 to 2014.  Compared with the ensemble result, the western region has a higher climate tendency rate and the northeast region is lower.  Also, there are some relatively low-value areas in the north plateau which BCC cannot simulate well.</p> <p>\u9752\u85cf\u9ad8\u539f\u571f\u58e4\u6e29\u5ea6\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u5206\u5e03\u56fe(zhou et al, 2022)</p>"},{"location":"Plume%20Model/","title":"Plume Model","text":"<p>Plume caused by deep sea mining has huge impact on the environment.
